# isixhosa-app

The isiXhosa translation of the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was developed and validated by a team of researchers at the University of Edinburgh (UK) and Stellenbosch University (South Africa).

This app includes audio recordings of the PHQ-9 items to enable people who may be more comfortable with spoken isiXhosa than written isiXhosa to complete the questionnaire.

Results from the validation study of the paper-based isiXhosa PHQ-9 can be found at this link:

Development of this app was funded by the University of Edinburghâ€™s Big Ideas Accelerator. Development of the isiXhosa PHQ-9 was funded by the Wellcome Trust (Grant 218493/Z/19/Z) and the Harold Hyam Wingate Foundation (Medical Research Travel Grant).
